New web site.

I signed up for The Grid a few months ago - a new platform for creating web sites. I've just been given the sign on for the beta testing, so thought I'd give it a go.

I'm going to start using it to link to some of my older sets of pics as well as when I finish editing a new set. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/71ee4972-dd7f-42cb-af78-b91b34432553.jpg)
