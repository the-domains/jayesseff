At the other end of the timescale, the most recent set I've edited is [this one ][0]of Diane. I've recently started using a friend's studio on my own to shoot people, not just during group workshops. I get even more photos out of these than I do in the workshops. As a result, this is the seventh set of pics from that shoot, with another 2 to come, in all likelihood.
