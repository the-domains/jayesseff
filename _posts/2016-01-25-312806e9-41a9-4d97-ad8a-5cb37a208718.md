One of my first projects when I got interested in photo editing was to go back to my pictures from my 1992 South American trip and to try to do something with them.

My travels took me to Chile, then cutting the corner of Argentina to go to Bolivia, before cutting the corner of Peru to go back to Chile, before ending the trip in Buenos Aires.

A couple of the pictures from the trip are included here; more are [here][0] on Flickr.
